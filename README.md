Python interface to ACM algorithm 772 (STRIPACK) fortran code for triangulation
on a sphere.  Includes routines from algorithm 623 for interpolation
(nearest neighbor, linear and hermite cubic).

to install ([numpy](http://numpy.org) and fortran compiler (preferably 
[gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran)) required):

* ``python setup.py build``
   - If you change the fortran compiler, you may have to add the 
flags `config_fc --fcompiler=<compiler name>` when setup.py is run
(see docs for [numpy.distutils] (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/distutils.html)).
* ``python setup.py install``

* to run test, execute ``python stripack/__init__.py``

* see source code <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/jswhit/stripack/master/stripack.html" target="_blank">docstrings</a> for documentation, 
[``test/fib_test.py``](https://github.com/jswhit/stripack/blob/master/test/fib_test.py) for example usage.

* see sample codes in ``fv3`` directory for applications to FV3 cubed sphere grids.
