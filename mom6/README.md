tools for interpolating native MOM6 tripolar grids to lat/lon

* generate_mom6mesh.py: pre-generate stripack mesh triangulation objects and store in pickle files.
                        edit to change path to MOM6 ocean_geometry.nc file before running.
                        takes resolution as command line arg ('python generate_mom6mesh.py 025' generates
                        mom6_mx025_grid.pickle)
* test_interp.py:       reads temp from MOM6 history interpolates to 1/4 deg
                        grid using pickled triangulation object generated by generate_fv3mesh.py
                        and makes a plot. Edit to change path to MOM6 history file.
